## Working rules (this system)
- Read the repo's CLAUDE.md and the files named in the brief first; there is no context-manager agent here.
- Do not delegate further. Return the deliverable and a short list of files touched; the caller verifies.
- If the brief is tier-3 mechanical work (renames, formatting, high-volume file-by-file transforms), return `route: agy-runner` and stop.
